        "1. Ambiguity in Language (Lexical & Syntactic Ambiguity)\n",
        "Problem:\n",
        "Words or phrases can possess various meanings based on the context. For instance, the term \"bank\" might refer to a financial institution or the edge of a river. Likewise, a statement like \"I saw the man with the telescope\" could imply that I used a telescope or that the man was in possession of a telescope.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why it's problematic:\n",
        "Text processing systems need to accurately discern the intended meaning to deliver precise outcomes. Misinterpretation can result in erroneous responses from chatbots, irrelevant search results, or flawed translations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Challenge 2:**\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Context Comprehension and Global Awareness\n",
        "Problem:\n",
        "Human interaction is significantly dependent on context, cultural allusions, and collective knowledge. For instance, the expression \"That movie was fire\" conveys a positive sentiment in contemporary slang, yet a literal interpretation by a system could lead to a misunderstanding as something harmful.\n",
        "Why it poses a challenge:\n",
        "In the absence of context or foundational knowledge, systems risk generating responses that are inappropriate, obsolete, or even offensive.\n",

        "**Challenge 3:**\n",

        "Issue:\n",
        "Individuals frequently utilize slang, abbreviations, emojis, typographical errors, or regional dialects. For instance: \"idk what u mean lol  ü§∑\" significantly contrasts with formal grammatical structures.\n",
        "Reasons for concern:\n",
